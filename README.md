# AlphaNoGo
Using ideas from AlphaGo Zero to apply to the NoGo game

## NoGo rules
1. board size 9x9
2. black go first, and then alternate turns
3. The goal is NOT to surround and take the stones occupied by the other player. Contrary, this will yield failure.
4. 'PASS' or 'SUICIDE' is also treated as failure.
5. There will always be one winner, no 'draw'
